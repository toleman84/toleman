# Evaluation

The evaluation consists of two tasks focusing on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The evaluation duration is `2 and a half hours`. You are allowed to use any online resources, including the course materials, but you are not allowed to communicate with other students or copy their code.

## Bookstore Management System

In this exercise, you will create a simple bookstore management system using Python. You will design a set of classes representing different types of books and their characteristics. The exercise will cover object-oriented programming, inheritance, basic Python data structures and functions, and JSON data serialization.

## Football Tournament Result

In this task, you are given the results of a football tournament as a list of strings, where each string represents a match. Each match contains the names of two teams and the outcome of the game (win, loss, or draw). Your goal is to process this information and calculate the standings of each team in the tournament.

## General Tips

Here are some general tips to help you approach the evaluation successfully:

1. Read the problem statement and requirements for each task carefully. Understand the expected functionality and behavior before starting to write code.
2. Plan your implementation. Design class hierarchies, define attributes and methods, and consider how the classes will interact with each other.
3. Follow good coding practices such as proper indentation, meaningful variable and method names, and clear commenting to enhance code readability.
4. Test your code thoroughly to ensure it meets the requirements. Consider edge cases and handle potential exceptions gracefully.
5. If you encounter any difficulties or have questions during the evaluation, don't hesitate to seek clarification or assistance from the staff.

Best of luck with your evaluation!
